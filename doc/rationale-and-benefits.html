<p>It can be difficult to find good documentation. Some reasons for this might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the developer is busy with other things and hasn’t yet made time to create or improve the docs</li>
<li>the developer doesn’t like or isn’t familiar with the available doc formats and/or tools</li>
<li>users were not helping improve the docs and the developer lost interest in doing it all him/herself</li>
<li>the developer isn’t very good at writing docs, and ends up avoiding writing them</li>
<li>some docs were written once, but no one pitched in and they got out of date</li>
<li>writing a full manual is a large task and takes a lot of motivation to get started</li>
<li>the developer is hesitant to invest time into and possibly get tied down to any one particular language-, project-, or technology-specific doc format or toolset</li>
<li>the developer simply doesn’t like writing docs, and the job keeps getting pushed to the bottom of the todo list</li>
</ul>
<p>But without good docs you won’t have many happy users. And without <em>them</em> you tend to lose motivation to work on your software.</p>
<p>Rippledoc aims to remedy the situation. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It’s particularly easy to use. You just create a <code>doc</code> directory, write some docs as simple text files, then run the script. Except for creating a _copyright file, there’s <em>zero</em> configuration required (you can optionally change the order your docs appear in the autogenerated toc.conf file). You don’t have to spend your time reading a manual or learning how to configure anything — just run the script, upload your docs to the web, and you’re done.</p></li>
<li><p>Your docs are formatted in Markdown (with some Pandoc enhancements). Pretty much everyone already knows Markdown (it’s used on Reddit, Stackoverflow, GitLab, GitHub, Discourse forums, in blogs and their commenting systems, and most README’s). Potential contributors will not have to learn any new markup formats or complicated tools to contribute to your docs.</p>
<p>Another benefit of using Markdown is that it looks great as plain text in your editor. Very easy to read, easy to write, easy syntax to remember. See the <a href="quick-markdown-example.html">quick markdown example</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>With Rippledoc, your docs are typically bite-sized aptly-named text files. This helps lower the procrastination barrier; you (and potential contributors) can start small. Write a small index.md and maybe an examples.md file, run rippledoc.py, and immediately get some results that you can make available. If unsure of where to start, see <a href="authoring-tips.html">authoring tips</a>.</p>
<p>This also greatly lowers the barrier for potential contributors. A collaborator can send you a single text file which could simply be dropped into your docs directory to automatically become a new article in your docs.</p></li>
<li><p>All of your doc pages have their markdown source readily available via a link in its footer (try it on this page), giving potential collaborators another way to quickly access doc source and/or send you changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Since they’re just static html (and md) files, to make the docs available online rsync/ftp/scp/upload your whole docs directory to your webserver or wherever the docs are hosted. Some module repositories, like Python’s <a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org">Cheeseshop</a>, will <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyPiDocumentationHosting">host plain html files like this for you</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, using Rippledoc <em>now</em> doesn’t tie you to continued use of Rippledoc in the future; it’s just a simple program that processes and stitches together markdown files. If you decide you don’t like it, just delete the generated files and you’re back to your plain directory of text files.</p></li>
