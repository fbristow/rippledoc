If you're not sure where to begin, do this:

~~~
cd my-project
mkdir doc
cd doc
touch index.md tutorial.md examples.md changes.md
~~~

Documentation files you might create:

index.md
  : Required. Should be your project's overview. Explain what your
    project is, what it does, and why folks would want to use it.  If
    your ../README.md already contains substantial overview material,
    consider moving much of that material into index.md. The content
    of index.md will render as the "front page" of your project's
    docs.

tutorial.md
  : For now can just be a walkthrough: detailed instructions, start to
    finish, on how to use some basic features of your project.

examples.md
  : Be sure to use syntax highlighting for your code snippets. If you
    have a lot of examples, skip the examples.md file and instead
    create an examples *directory* which you can then populate with
    *this-feature*.md and *that-feature*.md files.

changes.md
  : Please include version numbers and dates, and summarize
    user-facing changes. If readers are interested in seeing
    individual *code* changes, they can always look at the version
    control logs.

Other ideas for documents you (or potential contributors) might write:

  * __cheatsheet.md__
  * __quick-ref.md__
  * __manual.md__ (though consider using multiple manual files in their
    own doc/manual subdirectory)
  * __reference.md__ (for software libraries, this is may be taken care
    of by autogenerated API docs)
